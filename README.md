# Stuck Overflow

An API to help developers hopelessly stuck on some problem that someone somewhere in the world probably has an amazing solution for.

## Setup

To run, please copy the `stackoverfaux.json` file to the root directory of this project, then run `docker-compose up`. Docker Compose should set up PostgreSQL, run migrations, seed the database with sample data, and start the API server on port 3000.
