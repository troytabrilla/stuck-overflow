// @note Not using an ORM meant having to join data and manually populate deeply nested objects, which was getting
// hairy in the SQL queries, so I opted to fetch the data separately and join them in the application logic.
// It simplifies the code at the cost of less performance due to sending multiple queries. If performance
// becomes an issue, doing the joins in a single query and figuring out the nesting may be beneficial. Denormalizing
// the user data into the questions, answers, and comments tables could be quite useful in that case by reducing the
// amount of nesting by one level.
